# Foundation Models/Datasets for MATH/CS Problem Solving

### TBD..... reach out to us via [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/755517485096108153/1275024255637262336)

## Overview

This repo contains datasets of mathematics and theoretical computer science for the training of foundations models, also code to **download** such datasets, and **translate** such dataets to a unified[Pythorch Dataset format](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html) or [Tensorflow Dataset format](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/api_docs/python/tfds). 

Topics to be covered will be from mainstream college mathematics and theoretical computer science (discrete math, etc):
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics
- Odinary Differential Equations
- Partial Differentila Equaitons
- Optimization (linear, nonlinear, convex)
- Numerical analysis
- .........
- Recursion
- Boolean Algebra
- Trees, Graphs
- Searching/sorting algorithms, BFS, DFS, etc.
- Time and space complexity
